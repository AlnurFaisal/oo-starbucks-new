### Caveats
- this seemingly simple example is designed for you to practice OO modelling. later when we learn web APIs, there are helper libraries that can help us do things slightly differently
- Abstraction may seem confusing, but "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise"
- First time we're trying this format, so bear with us
